## What This?

This module has Google's [2 factor authentication fields] for [WT-Forms].

[2 factor authentication fields]: https://github.com/google/google-authenticator
[WT-Forms]: https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/

## Features
* Single-Page Application driven secret key generation.
* **QRCode Generation**
* Secret field and authentication validator that is based on [WTForms]

[WT-Forms]: https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/

## How to use

### If you want QR Code:
First, write the form to generate secret key and authenticate it:

`form.py`
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding=utf-8

from flask_wtf import Form
import wtforms.fields as fld
import wtforms.fields.html5 as fld5
import wtforms.validators as vld
from wtf_otp import OTPSecretKeyField, OTPCheck

class UserInfoForm(Form):
  name = fld.StringField()
  email = fld5.EmailField(validators=[
    vld.InputRequired(), vld.Email()
  ])
  password = fld.PasswordField()
  new_password = fld.PasswordField()
  confirm_password = fld.PasswordField(validators=[
    vld.EqualTo("new_password")
  ])
  secret = OTPSecretKeyField(
    qrcode_url="/qrcode", validators=[vld.InputRequired()]
  )

class LoginForm(Form):
  email = fld5.EmailField(validators=[
    vld.InputRequired(), vld.Email()
  ])
  passwrd = fld.PasswordField(validators=[
    vld.InputRequired()
  ])
  auth = fld.IntegerField(validators=[
    validators=[vld.InputRequired(), OTPCheck()]
  ])
```

Next, write the app as usual. However, you want to add a new route of which
path is "/qrcode" that generates the qrcode. Fortuantely, the sufficient
function is provided. An instance of `OTPSecretKeyField` provides `qrcode`
function:

```python
from .form import UserInfoForm

# /qrcode is assigned to generate_qrcode.
def generate_qrcode(req, res):
  form = UserInfoForm()
  secret = req.args.get("secret")
  if not secret:
      abort(404)
  res.make_response(form.secret.qrcode(
      secret, name="Test Example", issuer_name="Test Corp"
  ))
  resp.mimetype = "image/svg+xml"
```

Note that you can't get the instance by `UserInfoForm.secret`, because
`UserInfoForm.secret` returns an instance of `UnboundField`.

## If you don't want QRCode
If you don't want QRCode, just remove `qrcode_url` from the corresponding
classes and remove QRCode generation class.
